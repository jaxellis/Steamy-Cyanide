# Steamy-Cyanide

Cyan &amp; Amoled Steam Skin

## Pre-requisite:
[Steam Friends Patcher by PhantomGamers](https://github.com/PhantomGamers/SFP/)

## Installation:

1. Install SFP from the link above.
2. Copy the steamui folder in this repo to your Steam installation directory.
3. Make sure SFP is set to "Run on boot". SFP will auto patch the files into your Steam for ease of use.

## Customization:

While Steamy Cynaide is made for myself personally. I have particular tastes others might not be fond of.<br>
In the steamui folder you will find a config.css file that contains the color values for theming steam. Use RGB(a) or hex color values.<br>
Like `rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)` or `#000000` <br>
